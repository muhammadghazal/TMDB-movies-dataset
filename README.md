# TMDB Dataset Analysis â€“ Trends & Profit Drivers

## Overview  
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset to uncover key trends and profit drivers in the film industry. By cleaning, wrangling, and visualizing the data, the study examines factors such as budget, revenue, release patterns, and more. The goal is to identify predictive indicators of movie profitability and provide actionable insights for stakeholders.

## Data Sources  
- **TMDB Dataset:** A curated collection of movie-related data including budgets, revenues, genres, release dates, and ratings.

## Objectives  
- **Trend Analysis:** Identify how movie attributes (e.g., release timing, genres) correlate with trends in revenue over time.  
- **Profit Drivers:** Determine the key financial and content-related factors that drive profitability.  
- **Visualization:** Create clear, informative charts that reveal patterns and relationships within the dataset.

## Methodology  
- **Data Wrangling:** The raw TMDB data was cleaned and processed using Python (pandas, numpy).  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate distributional properties and relationships between variables.  
- **Visualization:** Charts and graphs were generated using matplotlib and seaborn to support insights derived from the analysis.

## Tools & Environment  
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

## How to Run the Project  
1. **Install Dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. **Download Data:** Place the TMDB dataset in the project folder or update the file paths accordingly.  
3. **Launch Notebook:** Open the provided Jupyter Notebook file and run the cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.  
4. **Review Report:** Insights, trends, and conclusions are documented in the notebook.

## Conclusion  
The analysis offers strategic insights into which factors significantly impact movie profitability, enabling better decision-making for film investors and marketers. For further details, please refer to the attached analysis report.
